# Multi-task_Learning
Multi-Task Learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. In deep learning, MTL refers to training a neural network to perform multiple tasks by sharing some of the networkâ€™s layers and parameters across tasks. It leverages shared information across related tasks to improve performance and generalization.

This repo gives a multi-task learning example for the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07115
